# TCP Server Template
This is a template for a Java TCP server and client. It includes a chatroom and a command processor.

## Getting Started

```
java -jar TCPServer.jar
```
For clients, same thing
```
java -jar TCPClient.jar
```
If you're on Windows, you can simply run run_windows.bat and it should open everything you need.
Otherwise on Linux, use run_linux.sh

### Prerequisites
